// This file gets executed after movie has started.
// It is not executed on the same frame the movie starts because of how the Source command buffer works.
// Optimally, whatever is set in here should be reset in svr_movie_end.
// Don't set host_framerate in this file as it is the only command SVR automatically executes.
